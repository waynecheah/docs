  npm init vuepress-theme-hope docs
  ```
  </CodeGroupItem>

  <CodeGroupItem title="yarn">
  ```bash
  yarn create vuepress-theme-hope docs
  ```
  </CodeGroupItem>
</CodeGroup>

## ðŸš€ Usage

// .vuepress/config.js
const { config } = require("vuepress-theme-hope");

module.exports = config({
  // your config here
});
```

::: tip
`config` is just a helper function, it will give you config description and provide auto-completion through TSâ€™s Interface and JSDoc.

At the same time, the `config` function will also complete some default configurations for your current configuration which will pass directly to VuePress.

Donâ€™t worry it will change your config! It will respect every config you make to make sure your other plugins work well.

You can view [Config of this site][docs-config] as an example.
